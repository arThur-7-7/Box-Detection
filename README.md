Amazon Problem Statement:
In warehouse logistics, parcels arrive randomly stacked on conveyor belts, requiring manual adjustment to ensure shipping labels face upwards for scanning. This process is labor-intensive and inefficient, especially when parcels overlap or obscure each other. 
This project aims to develop an AI-powered robotic arm system that uses computer vision and depth sensing to detect, segment, and determine the optimal pick-point for each parcel. A robotic arm with a smart gripper will then pick, rotate, and place parcels correctly. By automating parcel orientation and sorting, this system will enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in warehouse automation.

Approach:

1. Vision System for Parcel Detection & Pick-Point Estimation
To handle randomly stacked parcels, a multi-camera system (RGB-D + overhead LiDAR or stereo vision) is deployed to: here intel real sense.
Identify individual parcels, even if they are overlapping
Determine depth and height variations to find the topmost parcel
Locate the shipping label and calculate its orientation
AI Model for Parcel Segmentation & Label Detection
YOLOv8-seg + Depth Processing to segment each parcel.
Apply a pick-point estimation algorithm to detect the most accessible surface.
If a parcel is fully covered, mark it as temporarily inaccessible until the top parcels are processed.
Output from Vision System:
Parcel Bounding Boxes (XY Position + Depth)
Pick Point Coordinates (Where to grasp)
Label Location & Rotation Needed (0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°)
Model Output:
Label present? (Yes/No)
Label's current orientation? (Using bounding box coordinates)
Rotation needed? (Yes → Send to the robotic arm)

2. Robotic Arm with Smart Gripper for Parcel Manipulation
Once a pick point is determined, a 6+ DOF robotic arm with a versatile gripper picks up the parcel and reorients it as needed.
Choosing the Right Gripper:
Suction Gripper (Vacuum-Based) for flat surfaces & sealed boxes
Adaptive Two-Finger Gripper for irregular shapes
Steps for Parcel Orientation:
Pick the topmost parcel using the detected pick-point.
Determine the rotation required:
If the label is already facing up → Skip reorientation
If label is facing down → Flip 180°
If label is on the side → Rotate accordingly (90° or 270°)
Adjust parcel position using inverse kinematics (IK).
Place the reoriented parcel back on the conveyor.

3. Conveyor & Sorting Mechanism
The conveyor system is synchronized with the robotic arm to pause momentarily for picking and placing.
Parcels are placed back in the correct orientation, ensuring seamless downstream processing.
